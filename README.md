# Overview: Bikesharing
The purpose of this analysis is to create data representations for Citi Bike data collected August 2019. The charts and graphs presented in this repository will allow investors to make informed decisions regarding the Citi Bike service. 

# Results

The graphs represented in this analysis are focused towards gender breakdown, starting and ending locations. 

As seen in the two graphs below, top starting and ending locations for Citi bike renters are seen to be in fairly similar locations. The main areas for rental are centered around the tourist areas, which are around the Midtown Manhattan area.

![Top Ending Locations](https://github.com/patrickryanpo/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top%20Ending%20Locations.png)

Moving on to the gender breakdown of renters, it can be concluded that the male demographic dominates the Citi Bike rental market.

It was also discovered that majority of the male Citi Bike renters are subscribed to the rental service.

# Summary

Based on the information presented, it can be concluded that Citibikes are very popular within the Midtown Manhattan area. Due to the short trip duration, we can imply that popular starting and ending locations are also within a small area. 

For further analysis, I believe that it would be important to breakdown the data by purpose of use. At the moment, it cannot be determined whether majority of the users rent for leisure or for day-to-day travel. This would be critical information in determining future locations for CitiBike.
